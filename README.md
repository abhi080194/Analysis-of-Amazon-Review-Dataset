# ScalableDataAnalysis
Here we conduct analysis on Amazon review dataset.

To Run these code files first install these packages

Python NLTK
Pymongo API for python
Genesim Package for Topic Modeling
and all basic libraries for python

The Amazon data can downloaded from this link "http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/"
Download the 5-core review files, since access is only provided for those files

Instructions to install mongodb and creating a database and collections is provided in the project report.

There are 3 code files for different analysis question.
Code for analysis 1 and 2 is "Number_Of_Reviews_Years_And_Month.ipynb"
Code for analysis 3 is "Word_count_On_rating.ipynb"

In topic Modeling, we are not querying data from mongdb and using just one json file.So make sure give path
of particular json file while loading the data.

Code for analysis 4 is "Topic_Modeling.ipynb"
